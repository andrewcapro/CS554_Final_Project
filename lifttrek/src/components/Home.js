With countless muscles on the human body, and even more possible exercises, the options can be overwhelming and result in demotivation. With LiftTrek, you would be able to choose from a variety of muscles or muscle groups with a specific goal, and create a workout plan! At the same time, users can track their progress by uploading pictures after their workouts (with basic editing capabilities). Functioning as a form of social media, users can view exercise plans of other users and relevant images, leaving comments, likes, or adding the workout to their favorites.</p>
